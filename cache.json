U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles denied Exxon's bid to reverse the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors' denial of a trucking permit in early 2022, saying the board's decision was substantially supported by evidence that transporting crude oil by tanker trucks could present safety concerns on state highways.  Gee ruled that while Exxon has a right to operate its offshore oil platforms and related infrastructure in the area, it does not have a vested or fundamental right to use trucks to transport its crude while the pipeline system is fixed.",

Under the more likely scenario -- Kashkari pegged the probability at about 60% -- the Fed \"potentially\" raises rates one more quarter of a percentage point and then holds borrowing costs steady \"long enough to bring inflation back to target in a reasonable period of time,\" he said in an essay published on the regional Fed bank's website.  Inflation by the Fed's preferred measure has dropped from 7% last summer to 3.3% this past July, and U.S. unemployment has only ticked up a bit, reaching 3.8% at last read.",
